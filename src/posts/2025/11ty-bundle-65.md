**_A note from Bob:_**

Lots of momentum in 11ty-ville, with 21 new blog posts in this issue. I'm so glad that I can get these onto the site quickly with the set of CLI tools that I built ([and wrote about here](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/node-cli-of-my-dreams/)).

Enjoy the feast!

**Zach on images.** A [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0OHgC677ec) on how to optimize your images with Eleventy.

**A TypeScript proposal.** Zach opened a proposal to _[Add first-party core support for TypeScript configuration, data, and template files](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/3616)_.

**Another bookshelf.** With bookshelves proliferting among the Eleventy-erati, here's [another one from Jose](https://vzq.wtf/bookshelf/) and a [blog post on how they did it](https://vzq.wtf/blog/bookshelf/).

**Jason plugs-in URLs.** [Jason Garber](https://sixtwothree.org/) brings us [a plugin for generating /resource-style URLs](https://codeberg.org/jgarber/eleventy-plugin-routes#eleventy-plugin-routes).

**Ghost-ing with 11ty.** The people that created the Ghost publishing platform have some new docs on how to use it with Eleventy. [Check it out](https://ghost.org/docs/jamstack/eleventy/).

**Alex goes Auth-ing.** [Alex Ward](https://alextheward.com/) has built a new site with Eleventy, called [Auth Omnibus](https://authomnibus.com/). It seems to cover everything that anyone would want to know about authentication.

**We're Meetup-ing.** The next Eleventy Meetup is [on the calendar for February 6th](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-21-book-pages-and-privacy-first-analytics/). It features yours truly on _[How I built my Books page](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/building-the-book-page/)_. And [David Moll](https://davidmoll.net/) will cover _Umami + 11ty: A Privacy-First selfhosted approach to Web Analytics_.

Until next time...
