**_A note from Bob:_**

Good news! Knee replacement surgery went well. Tomorrow will be the 2-week mark. I'm sleeping slightly better (and slightly is doing a lot of work there). The pain has reached a more manageable level and I've had a little time to keep the firehose operational. Thanks to all of you who reached out with well wishes. I really appreciate it.

**11ty meetup tomorrow.** Tomorrow's Eleventy Meetup features [David Moll](https://davidmoll.net/), discussing _"Umami + 11ty: A Privacy-First selfhosted approach to Web Analytics_" and [Zach Leatherman](https://www.zachleat.com/) discussing _"Blog Awesome, from WordPress to 11ty — walkthrough the imminently shipping Font Awesome blog."_ Check out the [virtual event details](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-22-umami-analytics-and-blog-awesome/). I'll be there, possibly without bells.

**Node JS profiling docs.** New [in the docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/debug-performance/#node-js-profiling) is some great info on performance profiling node.js, _"The most reliable mechanism for tracking down performance issues in any Node.js based code is to use Node’s built-in CPU Profiling feature (Node v12+)."_

**Key releases.** Check out the [releases section below](#issue69-releases), there are performance improvements and bug fixes galore.

**Retaining optimized images across builds.** [Murtuzaali Surti](https://syntackle.com/) shows how to maintain optimized images across build in the `.cache` folder. This is a great build-time performance booster as unchanged images need not be re-optimized. [Check it out](https://syntackle.com/blog/eleventy-image-html-transform-plugin-disk-cache/).

Until next time...
