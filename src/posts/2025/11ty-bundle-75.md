**_A note from Bob:_**

Fewer than usual expositions from me this week as I got a late start. Regardless, there are some goodies down below. I hope you find something useful!

**Meetup happened.** [Episode 24 of THE Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/episode-24/) happened. Covering accessibility and full text search, videos are available from that link.

**Eleventy v3.1.1.** On the heels of v3.1.0 comes [v3.1.1](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.1.1), fixing some things. Check out those release notes.

**What is 88x31?** Someone was looking for one of those old-timey 88x31 footer GIF images featuring "Built with Eleventy." As it turns out, [Chris Burnell](https://chrisburnell.com/) had created one some time back. He got some new inspiration and created some new ones, some of which are even animated. Here's [a link to his post about them](https://chrisburnell.com/note/eleventy-animated-88x31/).

**Eleventy plugin image magnifier.** I don't remember where I found this, but it looks pretty cool. Created by [TÃ©otime Pacreau](https://www.teotimepacreau.fr/), [it's a plugin](https://github.com/teotimepacreau/eleventy-plugin-img-magnifier?tab=readme-ov-file#eleventy-plugin-img-magnifier--zoom-image-to-fullscreen) that lets you _"Enlarge images and create a lightbox to view fullscreen."_

**Still got stickers** The **[11ty Bundle stickers](https://bobmonsour.com/shop/)** are still available! Designed by [Andy Carolan](https://andycarolan.com), it's 4" x 2" with a matte-finish. They're $5 each. Tax & shipping are included in the price. Shipping them to anywhere in the world seems to be working. They've made it to the UK and Portugal so far, as well as both the east and west coasts of the US. [Get 'em while they're hot](https://bobmonsour.com/shop/)!
