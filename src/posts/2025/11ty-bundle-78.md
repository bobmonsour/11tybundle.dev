**_A note from Bob:_**

I said these would be monthly, and here we are on Sep 11, as scheduled. But with the passage of more time between issues, awesome people have been busy cranking out a ton of new stuff, as you'll see in this issue.

If you want to skip the preliminaries and get right to [the releases](#releases) or [the posts](#posts), or [the sites](#sites), have at it.

Enjoy!

**Why it's called Eleventy.** Curious about the name? [Here's the story](https://www.zachleat.com/web/history-of-eleventy-name/), complete with hardcopy archival documentation. Grab a tissue.

**11ty Meetup 9/17.** Join us for [episode 26 of the 11ty Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-26-building-sites-with-11ty-cms-and-silex/). Alex Hoyau will demo how [Silex](https://www.silex.me/) can be used to build 11ty sites visually. And Jessie with show us [11tyCMS](https://11tycms.com/), a _"local, serverless, dependable"_ CMS for 11ty.

**Speaking of CMS's.** I recently discovered [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms?tab=readme-ov-file#sveltia-cms-netlifydecap-cms-successor), _"a Git-based lightweight headless CMS under active development as a modern, powerful drop-in replacement for Netlify CMS and Decap CMS."_ And, while a little dated, [Dan Urbanowicz](https://danurbanowicz.com/), created an [11ty starter with it](https://github.com/danurbanowicz/eleventy-sveltia-cms-starter?tab=readme-ov-file#eleventy-sveltia-cms-starter).

**The ZeroPoint starter.** [Michael Delaney](https://mwdelaney.me/) showcases [ZeroPoint](https://getzeropoint.com/), _"A free, user-friendly static website generator starter project,"_ supporting GitHub Pages and Netlify.

**Vento 2 has arrived.** Vento, _"a modern, ergonomic, and async-friendly template engine for Javascript,"_ has a new major release. [Read about Vento 2](https://lume.land/blog/posts/vento-2/) and its new features. And since some in this community have written about it, there's now a [Vento category here on the bundle](/categories/vento/).

**Performance debgugging?** If you're wondering how long each of your pages are taking to render, Zach reminds us of the [Directory Output â€” Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/directory-output/) feature that's built right into 11ty.

**Components on the island.** If you're looking for a way to _"add interactive client-side components to your web site,"_ look no further than [\<is-land\>](https://github.com/11ty/is-land/tree/v5.0.0#is-land). And [v5.0.0 has just been released](https://github.com/11ty/is-land/releases/tag/v5.0.0).

Until next time...
