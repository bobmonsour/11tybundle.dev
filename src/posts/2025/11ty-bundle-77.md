**_A note from Bob:_**

Last I wrote, I suggested that the Bundle's blogs would be posted monthly, rather than every 2 weeks. Well, as I sit here, it's the 11th of August. And what better day of the month than the 11th to publish these posts. So here we are!

And August 11th also shares the significance of being my mother's birthday, may she rest in peace. I love thinking of her on this day and I very much enjoy sharing these posts with all of you.

Enjoy!

**Meetup videos.** Videos of the last Eleventy Meetup are now available on Youtube. [Here's a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJy3jyeGVYUpd4IUXPHCNf3r70o4zlnMj).

**WebNami blog generator.** WebNami, an opinionated and feature-rich 11ty-based blog generator, is now available. Check it out [on GitHub](https://github.com/webnami-dev/webnami?tab=readme-ov-file#webnami). Here's a [demo](https://webnami-blog.pages.dev/).

**Blue Rose starter.** Created by [Melanie Kat](https://melkat.dev/), Blue Rose is a starter that bills itself as _"A lightweight, responsive, and highly performant gallery for photos and videos for use with 11ty."_ [Check it out here](https://melkat.dev/melanie/blue-rose#readme). Here's a [demo](https://bluerose.melkat.dev/).

**New Speedlify leaderboard.** Zach updated the [Speedlify leaderboard](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/) on August 2nd.

**Zach does weird image tricks.** Zach shows us [One weird trick to reduce Eleventy Image Build Times by 60%](https://www.zachleat.com/web/faster-builds-with-eleventy-img/). I have not tried this yet, but it sounds promising!

**Fruity new starter.** [Kate Bagenzo](https://katebagenzo.neocities.org/) brings us [Strawberry Starter](https://github.com/kate-bagenzo/strawberry-starter#-strawberry-starter). The [installation guide](https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/posts/example_posts/installation/) is really well done. It has earned a spot here on the [Starters page](/starters).

## One more thing...

**Stickers are still available.** [Get yours!](https://bobmonsour.com/shop/). Only $3 each, tax & shipping included.
