**_A note from Bob:_**

Some hot news! During the last Eleventy Meetup, Zach alluded to a major new project that he would be working on in the coming months. And as much as we tried to pry out the nature of it from him, he did not relent.

That said, I have a source close to contributors in the Eleventy-sphere and he shared some details of this mysterious new project. [Check out what he had to say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

**11ty meetup videos.** Videos from the March 20th Meetup are out. Here's [the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJy3jyeGVYUoyTlnt_S3Bni9XOmXjTm1t) with both videos, featuring David Moll on using Umami with 11ty, and Zach Leatherman on moving the [Font Awesome blog](https://blog.fontawesome.com/) from Wordpress to Eleventy (here's [the blog post about it](https://blog.fontawesome.com/blog-awesome-to-11ty/)).

**Getty does digital books.** This looks like a pretty amazing project by [Getty](https://www.getty.edu/). It's called [Quire](https://quire.getty.edu/) and it's an open source, 11ty-based project to _"Create scholarly, visually rich digital books that last."_ And there's a [Vimeo video about it](https://vimeo.com/820983026/b3a116fb1e).

**Speedlify updated.** Zach has updated the [Speedlify leaderboard](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/) of 11ty sites. He's limited the sites listed and only has included those with a total Lighthouse score of 400 (aka 4 hundos). Sadly, none of my sites made the cut...I've got work to do.

**California is engaged with 11ty.** The state of California has released a new 11ty-based site called [Engaged California](https://engaged.ca.gov/). It looks very well done and I hope that it's as effective as it is pretty.

**11ty info architecture improvements.** Here's a [summary of some of the sidebar menu improvements](https://github.com/11ty/11ty-website/pull/1782) to the 11ty site. Some of them are already live [on the site](https://www.11ty.dev/). Love this stuff!

**Chobble does starters.** Stefan Burke, at [chobble.com](https://chobble.com/), has blessed us with a new starter aimed at small businesses. He's got two demos of it up, [one for a product business](https://example.chobble.com/) ([source](https://git.chobble.com/chobble/chobble-template)) and [one for a trades-person business](https://tradesperson-example.chobble.com/) ([source](https://git.chobble.com/chobble/tradesperson-example)). Stefan also wrote [an overview blog post](https://blog.chobble.com/blog/25-03-28-chobble-template/) about the templates. For those of you serving small business clients or solo trades-people clients, these could be a good fit.

Until next time...
