## _Bundles of 11ty know-how_

![screengrab of the homepage for 11tybundle.dev](homescreenshot.png)

I started this project after producing several newsletter-type blog posts on my personal website, [bobmonsour.com](https://www.bobmonsour.com). I called those blog posts [The 11ty Bundle](https://www.bobmonsour.com/tags/11ty-bundle/). I wanted to create a single place where I could share resources and information about Eleventy.

While I had already been working on some of the technical underpinnings for the site as inaccessible features on my personal site, I felt it was time to give it its own home.

As of late January 2026, you can find more than 1,600 blog posts across more than 50 [categories](https://www.11tybundle.dev/categories/) written by more than 400 [authors](https://www.11tybundle.dev/authors/).

Included in each Bundle blog post are: (1) a list of blog posts recently written by a variety of authors, (2) releases of official Eleventy repos, and (3) a list of just a some of the more recent sites built with Eleventy. On each page's footer, you'll also find a list of official and community resources.

I have learned, and am still learning a ton while building this project. I hope you find it useful in your work with Eleventy.
