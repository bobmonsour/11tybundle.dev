# 11tybundle.dev - Bundles of 11ty know-how

![screengrab of the homepage for 11tybundle.dev](homescreenshot.png)

Back in 2023, I started this project after producing several newsletter-type blog posts on my personal website, [bobmonsour.com](https://www.bobmonsour.com). I called those blog posts [The 11ty Bundle](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/11ty-bundle-1-4/). I wanted to create a single place where I could share resources and information about Eleventy. After working on some of the technical underpinnings for the site, it was time to give it its own home.

As of January 2026, with a new design, you can find more than 1,600 blog posts across more than 50 [categories](https://11tybundle.dev/categories/) written by more than 400 [authors](https://11tybundle.dev/authors/).

With the redesign, we've also added a showcase of screenshots of over 1,400 sites built with Eleventy. You can find that at [https://11tybundle.dev/showcase/](https://11tybundle.dev/showcase/).

Typically monthly, on the 11th of the each month, each Bundle blog post contains: highlights of what's going on in the Eleventy community, (1) releases of official Eleventy repos, (2) a list of blog posts recently written by a variety of authors, and (3) a list of just a some of the more recent sites built with Eleventy. On each page's footer, you'll also find a list of official and community resources.

I hope you find it useful in your work with Eleventy.
