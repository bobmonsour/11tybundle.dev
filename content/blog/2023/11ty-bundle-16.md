> TL;DR Zach's [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXcxvBJuULU) of CloudCannon's configuration and CMS while showing off [esif.dev](https://esif.dev/). 13 new posts and 10 new sites. I'm back from vacation...only to be leaving again. If you want to jump to the posts...[go ahead](#newposts), I won't be offended.

Wow! It's been more than 2 weeks since I've posted one of these. It feels like an eternity. With August being August, I had a birthday last week (68 ain't so bad), and we traveled a bit. I've been keeping up with adding content if you've been watching the [Firehose](/firehose/) page.

Zach put out a cool video that you can watch below or [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXcxvBJuULU). It's nice to get a look at how CloudCannon works, both the build part and the CMS part.

What's really cool is that he demo's the capabilities by building a microsite that he calls [Educational, Sensational, Inspirational, Foundational](https://esif.dev/), aka [esif.dev](https://esif.dev/). Zach asked the community to suggest "what blog posts were most influential to how you build for the web?" There's something for everyone to learn from. Be sure to [check it out](https://esif.dev/).

We've got 13 new posts since last time and 10 new sites. People are building with Eleventy and telling people about it.

There's also a cool new starter called [elva](https://github.com/scottsweb/elva). It bills itself as a "A multilingual, clean, green, 11ty starter theme. Elva provides solid foundations for your next web project." You'll also find it living on the [Starters](/starters/) page.

And while there are no new releases to report, Zach posted that he has "Added support for resolving ESM dependencies for --watch/--serve and Added support for .mjs extension to Data Files." I don't have a sense of when these will be officially released, but Zach called this a "Big Deal."

Well, we're off again, but this time out of the country. We'll be in Italy for 2 weeks, the first of which my wife is taking a painting class, while I tour around Florence. And then we head to Venice to visit some of her cousins. I've spent a lot of time on Duolingo sharpening my Italian skills, but am I confident? I am not. Next, I'm headed to San Diego to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of [Stac Electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stac_Electronics). The founding team has stayed in some level of touch over the years. It will be great to see everyone. 40 freakin' years...it's hard to believe.

Then we head to LA to help our son move into a new place. And lastly, it's off to Minnesota to attend a cousin's wedding. It's going to be a busy 2 months. I'll do my best to keep up with the new content.

I have a list of things I want to implement, but the concentrated time has just not been available recently.

Until next time...
