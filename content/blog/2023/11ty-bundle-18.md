I happen to get notifications of all things Eleventy on GitHub. One came across from Evan Sheehan (aka, Darth Mall) indicating that he had not renewed the 11ty.webc.fun domain and would not be maintaining the site. Knowing that it was a great resource, I decided to clone the repo and host it on my Netlify account. For all the WebC fans, [you can find it here](https://11tywebcfun.netlify.app/). If anyone wants to take it over as a maintainer, please feel free. A read-only version of Evan's repo for the site can be found at [https://github.com/darthmall/11ty.webc.fun/](https://github.com/darthmall/11ty.webc.fun/).

On another resource note, I don't recall how I happened upon this, but Jens Grochtdreis has created a [gist of list of 11ty links](https://gist.github.com/jensgro/ca3ebb573f2bf49780d9e9853698f1c2). There are some duplicates of what I have in the footer of each page here, but I was pleased to see this site listed as one of the recent updates.

On to the meat of the issue...there's 1 release, 14 new posts, and 10 new sites to check out below.

Until next time...
