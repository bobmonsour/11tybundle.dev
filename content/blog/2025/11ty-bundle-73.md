### A note from Bob:

After 6 weeks of life disruption, living in different places, it's nice to be back home (and with 2 large displays instead of my laptop). And today, I get a long overdue haircut. Knee rehab is going well and my wife has tolerated her radiation treatments well. Onward!

A quick heads-up: in the event of a summer slowdown in content, it might be more than the typical 2 weeks between issues. Regardless, the [Firehose RSS feed](/firehosefeed.xml) will bring you all the posts as I find them.

**Nunjucks lives.** [Natalie Carey](https://nataliecarey.uk/) has put out [a proposal for Nunjucks maintenance](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks/issues/1484). And [nunjucks4 is currently in alpha](https://github.com/nunjucks/nunjucks4). Happy to see this project get some love.

**The Bundle turned 2.** ICYMI, this very site turned 2 years old on May 1st. I wrote a recap of the year: [1 + 1: Celebrating 2 years of the 11ty Bundle](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/1-+-1:-celebrating-2-years-of-the-11ty-bundle/).

**A CMS for .NET.** If you're into .NET and are looking for a CMS for your Eleventy sites, [Steven Harland](https://fullhack.dev/) has you covered. Check it out at [fr1end1y 🧡🎈](https://fr1end1y.fullhack.dev/about/).

**Have snacks with your murals.** [Melanie Richards](https://melanie-richards.com/) brings us [World Snacks](https://snacks.melanie-richards.com/). And a group of Philadelphia artists delivers at [Murals Arts Philadelphia](https://catalog.muralarts.org/) with this year's theme being “Mural Arts: The Place Where Art Meets Hope.” Both are built with [Figma Sites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsFIvULxkHI)...oh wait...I mean Eleventy.

Until next time...
