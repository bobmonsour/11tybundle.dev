### A note from Bob:

**REMINDER.** The next Eleventy Meetup is [on the calendar for February 6th](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-21-book-pages-and-privacy-first-analytics/). It features yours truly on _[How I built my Books page](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/building-the-book-page/)_. And [Sia Karamalegos](https://sia.codes/) will cover _Using 11ty to build a data and chart analytics website_. The time is 9am Pacific. Hope to see some of you there!

Incidentally, I've reduced the number of RSS feed entries for this blog and the Firehose blog to 20 of the most recent entries. Funny thing, someone who recently subscribed to the Firehose feed told me of the 1,337 entries that were in the feed. I remarked to him that we had reached peak ["Leet"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet).

### Highlights

**Installing a JavaScript Runtime.** New on the Eleventy docs, Zach shows how to install Node or Deno for use with your Eleventy projects. [Read more](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/javascript-runtime/).

**Plug in your Font Awesome.** A new plugin, [eleventy-plugin-font-awesome](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-font-awesome#11tyfont-awesome) provides _"Optimized per-page tree-shaken SVG spritesheets for Eleventy with Font Awesome icons."_

**A fruity red starter.** [Strawberry Starter](https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/) is here. There's an [Installation Guide](https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/posts/example_posts/installation/), a [User Reference](https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/posts/example_posts/user-ref/), some [Markdown Examples](https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/posts/example_posts/markdown-example/), and a [FAQ & Troubleshooting page](https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/posts/example_posts/faq/).

**From Instagram to Pixelfed.** With the reent mass migration from Instagram to Pixelfed, [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/) shows us how to [bring those images into Eleventy](https://rknight.me/blog/loading-pixelfed-photos-with-eleventy/).

**RSS entries are ID'd.** As some of you may have watched, I have thrashed around over the last week or so with RSS entry IDs. I place full blame on this recent obsession on [Evan Sheehan's blog post](https://darthmall.net/2025/on-the-importance-of-stable-ids/), which catalyzed my journey. I worked on several incremental approaches until finally landing on a solution that I'm happy with. You can read all about it on [Ok, this is my 'final' final word on RSS entry IDs](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/final-final-word-on-rss-entry-ids/). But you should read [Evan's post](https://darthmall.net/2025/on-the-importance-of-stable-ids/) first to have it all make sense. That ['final' post of mine](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/final-final-word-on-rss-entry-ids/) also contains the full list of 7 posts that I wrote along the way. I'm done with this topic for now. I promise.

**A variety of posts.** This issue has everything from [setting up a site with Tailwind](https://abdullahyahya.com/2025/02/set-up-a-simple-and-reliable-static-site-generator-using-11ty-eleventy-tailwind-css/), [open graph images](https://blog.embee.co/posts/11ty-open-graph-funtimes/), [plain text RSS feeds](https://nooshu.com/blog/2025/01/29/lets-create-a-plaintext-rss-feed-with-11ty/), [a VS Code snippet for front matter](https://chrismcleod.dev/blog/visual-studio-code-snippet-for-markdown-frontmatter/), a [5-part series on builing a seasonal veg app](https://yasmin.bearblog.dev/building-an-eleventy-app-part-1/), and much much more.

**A new look here.** I recently commissioned [Andy Carolan](https://www.andycarolan.com/) to design a new OG image for the 11ty Bundle. I became interested in his work after seeing the images he created for [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com/). You'll start seeing it on social media posts and in the email version of the blog. I'm very happy with the result. Thanks, Andy!

Here's what it looks like:

See if you can find all of the _"11s"_ in the image.

Enjoy!

Until next time...
