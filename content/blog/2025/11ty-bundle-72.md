### A note from Bob:

I've been spending so much time preparing a post for [my personal site](https://bobmonsour.com/) about the coming (May 1st) 2nd anniversary of the launch of the 11ty Bundle site that I completely forgot that I had to get this issue out. Fortunately, I remembered in time and...here we are.

### Highlights

**We Met Up.** Check out the [Eleventy Meetup event details](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-23-notion-as-a-cms-and-component-prototyping/) for the most recent meetup videos. [Michael Delaney](https://mwdelaney.me/) shared "Rapidly(?) Developing Front-End Components with 11ty" and [vrugtehagel](https://vrugtehagel.nl/) shared "Using Notion as CMS with your Eleventy site."

**Eleventy v3.1.0-beta.1.** It's smaller! It's faster! Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.1.0-beta.1).

**Ethan brings the Magick.** [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/) shows us how he [uses ImageMagick to generate his open graph images](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/magick-images/).

**Chris hits a double.** [Christopher Kirk-Nielsen](https://chriskirknielsen.com/), [doubles your pagination](https://chriskirknielsen.com/blog/double-pagination-in-eleventy/) fun and [test drives VentoJS](https://chriskirknielsen.com/blog/taking-vento-js-for-a-spin-in-eleventy/), yet another template language

Until next time...
