### A note from Bob:

### Highlights

**We Meetup'd.** The Eleventy Meetup was a success. [Sia Karamalegos](https://sia.codes/) showed us how to use 11ty to [build a data and chart analytics website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o13Yfgzne88). And I showed [how I built my Books page](https://bobmonsour.com/notes/11ty-meetup-how-i-built-my-books-page/). Those links go to the recording of Sia's talk and my blog post, respectively. You can see all of the meetup's recordings on the [Eleventy Meetup YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@THEEleventyMeetup).

Until next time...
