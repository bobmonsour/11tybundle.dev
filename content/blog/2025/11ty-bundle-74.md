### Highlights

**Meetup tomorrow.** [Episode 24 of the Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/episode-24/) is Thursday (May 29). Learn about the European Accessibility Act from [Fabian Wohlgemuth](https://feynmatt.com/) and DIY Full-Text Search with [Vlad Korobov](https://vladkorobov.com/).

**Eleventy v3.1.0.** [v3.1.0](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.1.0) is out and while nice, Zach is vigorously working on v3.1.1, fixing a handful of regressions that have popped up since the release. That said, v3.1.0 is 22% smaller and 11% faster! I'm running my personal site with it as well as this very 11ty Bundle site.

**X-GOVUK docs~~UK Gov docs~~.** X-GOVUK ~~The UK government~~ has released [GOV.UK.Eleventy plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-eleventy-plugin/). As they tell it: _"Write documentation using Markdown and publish it using GOV.UK styles."_ I think they're on to something. _UPDATE: It was pointed out to me that this is NOT an official UK government project, but rather a community project._

**Eleventy LibDoc.** Speaking of docs, a beautifully designed _"starter project to craft slick and responsive documentation"_ has arrived. Check out the [Eleventy LibDoc website](https://eleventy-libdoc.netlify.app/) and the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ita-design-system/eleventy-libdoc#eleventy-libdoc). I've added this to the [Starters page](/starters/).

**Grease fire!** [Adam Stoddard](https://aaadaaam.com/) has updated his [Grease starter](https://web-grease.netlify.app/) with a new design and it's a beauty! As Adam puts it: _"Grease is a website starter for the modern web. Its goal is simple; provide a solid foundation for a fast and adaptable website that’s enjoyable to build, and easy to maintain."_

**BWE RSS.** The home page of the Bundle now includes a new [RSS feed for the new sites](https://11tybundle.dev/sitesfeed.xml) that are Built with Eleventy (aka BWE). If you want to see what crosses my radar, subscribe to that feed.

**Believe in Mermaid(s).** [Kevin Gimbel](https://kevingimbel.de/) has released a plugin called [eleventy-plugin-mermaid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kevingimbel/eleventy-plugin-mermaid). [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/), for the uninitiated, is a _"JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically."_ I think it's pretty cool and will keep it in mind for possible use in future blog posts.

**Eleventy in the browser?** I was confused at first, but then gave it a try. The [demo app](https://11ty-website-git-editor-11ty.vercel.app/#try-eleventy-in-the-browser) let's you edit a file in the browser and see the results...sorta CodePen-ish.

**Got stickers?** I've teased this on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@bobmonsour/114535942160630118) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/bobmonsour.com/post/3lpk7t27wnc25), but the time has arrived for the launch of the **11ty Bundle sticker**! Designed by [Andy Carolan](https://andycarolan.com), it's 4" x 2" with a matte-finish. They're $5 each. Tax & shipping are included in the price and I'll (do my best to) ship them to anywhere in the world.

For details on how to get one, check out my [shop](https://bobmonsour.com/shop/) and see what it looks like on my laptop. As of today, May 27, 2025, I've got 49 of them left, and I'm not sure I'll do any more. I also wrote a [promo blog post about the launch](https://bobmonsour.com/blog/got-stickers/) on my personal site.

Hat tip to [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/) for the idea of using [Stripe's payment links](https://stripe.com/gb/payments/payment-links) to get this up and running quickly. [Robb's got stickers too!](https://rknight.me/blog/dont-at-me-stickers/)
