## A note from Bob:

As I think I mentioned on social media, posts and sites have been pouring in (meaning I've searched high and low for these)...enough so that I felt it best to put out a mid-month bundle issue, making it a bit more digestible for everyone. I hope you enjoy it!

## Highlights

**Lessons learned.** [Lee Cattarin](https://leecat.art/) provides us with [eleventy lessons](https://leecat.art/eleventy-lessons/), sharing lessons learned from building multiple websites with Eleventy, focusing on implementing features like related posts, featured images, pagination, and tag image previews.

**Fantasy football.** [Silvestar Bistrović](https://www.silvestar.codes) shows us [How he built UltiGameMate with Eleventy and Supabase](https://www.silvestar.codes/articles/how-i-built-ultigamemate/), a fantasy football web app, using Eleventy for static site generation and Supabase for authentication and database management.

**Ignor-ance is bliss.** [Josh Sherman](https://joshtronic.com), describes how to [Ignore Files with Eleventy](https://joshtronic.com/2026/02/15/eleventy-ignoring-files/). I have found this useful at times when I want to make a build go quite a bit faster than a full build.

**IndieWeb all the way.** [Ricardo Mendes](https://rmendes.net) shows how to [Deploy Your Own IndieWeb Site with Indiekit + Eleventy)](https://rmendes.net/content/articles/2026-02-14-deploying-your-own-indieweb-site/), enabling users to build independent blogs with Micropub support and social media syndication; and it uses Docker Compose (whatever that is).

**Good meddling.** [Brennan Brown](https://brennan.day/) brings us [Meddler](https://brennan.day/introducing-meddler/), an amazing looking tool to export your Medium articles as markdown files, ready for importing them into Eleventy (or another SSG).
