## A note from Bob:

For some reason, it feels like a long time since the last issue. There's a ton of content in this one, a boatload of posts, sites, and more. I hope you enjoy it! I may have to bump the frequency of these up so they're not so large, or have another way to dribble out the content. Those of you making good use of RSS may already be caught up as we have feeds for the [blog posts](/firehosefeed.xml), the [showcase entries](/showcasefeed.json), and the [releases](/releasefeed.xml).

## Highlights

**Eleventy met-up.** There were two great talks at the recent meetup. [Stefan Burke](https://chobble.com/) showed how to [Use guardrails with code-generating LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLrQSRoVKSg) and [Josh Vickerson](https://softclay.software/) told us about [Incremental Content Management with Laravel & 11ty](https://www.joshvickerson.com/posts/incremental-content-management-with-laravel-and-eleventy/).

**Brewventy starter.** [Kyle Reddoch](https://www.kylereddoch.me/) brings us [Brewventy](https://github.com/kylereddoch/brewventy#brewventy-eleventy-starter), _"A coffee-themed, fully customizable Eleventy starter project combining elegant design with powerful functionality."_

**A chart plugin.** [Sean Lunsford](https://seanlunsford.com/) released [Uncharted](https://github.com/slunsford/uncharted#uncharted), _"A CSS-based chart plugin for Eleventy."_

**Sveleven starter.** [Anton Staroverov](https://any.digital/) created [Sveleven](https://github.com/anydigital/sveleven#sveleven), an _"Ultra-lightweight, modern Eleventy v4 starter (with Tailwind & CMS included!)"_

**11tyCMS beta.** [Jessie Heald](https://jessieheald.com/) has released a beta of [11tyCMS](https://11tycms.com/blog/posts/11tycms-public-beta-releases-and-source-windows-and-linux-support-minor-refactors-and-css-improvements/). You can check out [Public Beta 1](https://github.com/jh97uk/11tyCMS/releases/tag/beta). They're seeking feedback on the beta, so if you have a chance to check it out, please do and let them know what you think.

**Tricks of the trade.** [Anton Staroverov](https://any.digital/) shares some [Nunjucks & Liquid tips and tricks](https://any.digital/tricks/njk-liquid/). This is just one of Anton's [Eleventy Tricks](https://any.digital/tricks/11ty/).

**Eleventy survival.** [Zach](https://zachleat.com) shared his thoughts on [How Eleventy Survived: Funding, Growth, and Open Source Reality](https://www.zachleat.com/web/podcast-awesome-eleventy-open-source/) on the Podcast Awesome podcast.

**The Newsprint Theme.** [Brennan Brown](https://brennan.day/) brings us a new starter he calls [The Newsprint Theme](https://github.com/brennanbrown/newsprint#%EF%B8%8F-newsprint), _"A newspaper-style blog built with Eleventy (11ty) embracing a classic newspaper aesthetic while functioning as a newsletter-first publication."_ The [demo](https://newsprint.netlify.app/) looks fantastic.

**Bundle insights.** And finally, I've created a [Bundle insights page](/insights/) that _"... explores the data collected from authors' sites and their blog posts to uncover patterns and areas for improvement."_
