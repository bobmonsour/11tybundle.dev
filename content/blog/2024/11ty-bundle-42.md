### Highlights

**I had some downtime.** While we're down in So Cal visiting our son, I had a little downtime, so I thought I'd put this issue out shortly before the [11ty conference](https://conf.11ty.dev/) to get everyone jazzed up.

**11ty conference is TOMRROW, May 9th!** Here's the [schedule of talks](https://conf.11ty.dev/#schedule). It's **FREE**, single-track, and virtual. If you've waited until the last minute, well...the last minute has finally arrived. Now's the time to [register](https://conf.11ty.dev/#register).

**Some releasings.** See below for some new releases. We're on the verge of 3.0! Zach will be giving a talk titled _"[The Future of 11ty](https://conf.11ty.dev/2024/the-future-of-11ty/)"_ described as _"A talk about the current state of the 11ty project, new tricks and releases, and where we’re going next."_ I'm looking forward to that!

**An 11ty Firefox profiler.** Noted on the Discord server, Flo published [an npm package](https://github.com/fqueze/11ty-fx-profiler/) _"to visualize how Eleventy spends time when building my website"_. I haven't tried it, but it looks interesting.

**Another icon plugin** It was brought to my attention that [uncenter](https://uncenter.dev/) had also produced an icon-access package called [eleventy-plugin-icons](https://github.com/uncenter/eleventy-plugin-icons#readme) that you can use with a wide variety of icon sets, beyond the [Lucide icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) that I referred to in the [last issue](/blog/11ty-bundle-41/). [Check it out](https://github.com/uncenter/eleventy-plugin-icons#readme)! And like last issue's plugin, you can use shortcodes like this {% raw %}{% icon "star" %}{% endraw %}. Pretty cool! I'd like to add that uncenter is among the most prolific supporters on the Discord server, always ready to help out. And he's currently a high school student. I think he's going to have an amazing future.

Until next time...
