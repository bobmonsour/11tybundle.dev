And...this also just in, [Lene Saile](https://www.lenesaile.com/en/) just updated her excellent [Eleventy Excellent starter](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app) to 2.0. It's a great starter for Eleventy. Be sure to check it out. She has written [a blog post about the starter](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/blog/eleventy-excellent-20/)...on the starter demo itself.

Enjoy the 8 posts and 8 sites to see this week.

Until next time...
