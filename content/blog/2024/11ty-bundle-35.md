### Highlights

**Some gentle reminders.** The [open call for talk proposals for the 11ty conference](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdwhO1zfEBvl8mVAJQLWbK0EylD4yPCBpe3Lanz8SvFPI9Xg/viewform) ends on March 22nd. And there's also an open call to companies and individuals to sponsor the conference. Send an email to [sponsor@11ty.dev](mailto:sponsor@11ty.dev) to receive a sponsorship prospectus.

**Speed up your build times.** New on the docs: how to persist Eleventy Cache across builds to improve build times, including updated information on CloudCannon, Netlify, and Vercel. [Check it out](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/deployment/#persisting-cache).

**Got contact forms?** If you've ever been looking for options to add forms to your static site, well [this CloudCannon page is for you](https://cloudcannon.com/jamstack-ecosystem/contact-forms/). I'd give you a count of all the options, but it's just too many to eyeball...and I'm in a hurry right now.

**Eleventy Base ~~Blog~~ Webc Starter (it's not a blog).** The [Eleventy Base ~~Blog~~ using WebC](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-webc) has been updated to Eleventy 3.0.0 using ESM. It's a great way to get ~~your blogging~~ started with Eleventy and WebC. It's just sitting there, waiting to be deployed.

**Email or beer?** In case you haven't noticed, I've added a couple of buttons to this site. At the end of each of these blog posts, I invite you to send me an email...in the unlikely event that you want to send me your thoughts about the post. And at the end of every ~~page~~ _post_ ~~of the site~~, you are now presented with the option to buy me a beer. I have plenty of coffee, but not enough beer. I'll leave it at that.

That's all for now...until next time...
