### Highlights

**Zach's Eleventy Weekly Report №5.** First, we're up to alpha.14 (and this site is running on it). Rather than put the rest of it into my own words, I'll share [Zach's Mastodon post](https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy/112711796611167140) where he's been outlining his weekly progress on all things Eleventy.

**A couple of v3 upgrade posts.** [Alex Zappa](https://alex.zappa.dev) and I each wrote posts about upgrading to version 3. [Here is Alex's](https://alex.zappa.dev/blog/upgrading-to-eleventy-v3/) and [here is mine](https://www.bobmonsour.com/posts/upgrade-and-debug/). You can also find these, along with others in the [Upgrading category](/categories/upgrading/).

**Zach on the Windows Terminal.** Zach wrote [a post](https://www.zachleat.com/web/smorgasbord-windows-terminal/) about the challenges with various forms of Terminal functionality on Windows. In it, he outlines what he's done to make it easier, including adding a [tabbed interface in the quick start docs](https://www.11ty.dev/#quick-start) to provide specific guidance.

**Not Eleventy-related, but fun.** I subscribe to [Cassidy Williams'](https://cassidoo.co/) newsletter. Today's issue had a link to a [20-minute-ish talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMhcL2yL7RI&list=PLXDU_eVOJTx402DljIPagaDKLibF-qfF0&index=27) given by [Josh Wardle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/), the author of the popular word game, Wordle. He spoke about how he developed the game. But, what struck me was how he described the way the game has become a way for people to stay connected. I play it every day and I share my result with 3 close friends on the east coast. Two of them are guys I went to high school many moons ago and the other is the widow of another high school friend. They all share theirs too and we give each other shit from time to time, like the time I failed to solve the game 2 days in a row. It's a small, fun, and powerful way to stay connected. And the path that the game took from his developing it for his partner to selling it to the New York Times is fascinating.

Until next time...
