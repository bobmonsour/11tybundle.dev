### A note from Bob:

It's good to be back home, and to be coming off of the high from the 11ty Conference. Whew!

### Highlights

**11ty Conference on YouTube.** Here's [a playlist of all the talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLxJ6PtuF9M&list=PLwhCq3ZFGOGgetCSWisU2pkl9AFwQVxWJ). It was a great event, and I'm looking forward to the next one. And here's the 5-minute [personal sites montage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-aQ7_yD44s) that ran during the breaks. And then there's [Zach's post](https://www.zachleat.com/web/11tyconf-keynote-2024/), featuring his talk on The Future of 11ty (2024) along with the full slide deck.

**Integrate Eleventy with Mermaid.** I had to look it up, but [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) is a diagramming and charting tool. [Kevin Gimbel](https://kevin.gimbel.dev/ops/) has integrated it with Eleventy with [a plugin](https://github.com/KevinGimbel/eleventy-plugin-mermaid).

**Keeping Out Dark Visitors.** If you want to block AI scrapers and crawlers without having to maintain your own robots.txt file, [Shiv J.M.](https://shivjm.blog/) shows us how to generate one using the [Dark Visitors API](https://darkvisitors.com/docs/robots-txts-api). Here's his [blog post with the details](https://shivjm.blog/colophon/keeping-out-dark-visitors/). Note: Shiv is one of the most prolific helpers on the [11ty Discord server](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord/). If you need help and you're not going there for answers, you should seriously consider it.

**A Ghostly logo.** [David Darnes](https://darn.es/) collaborated with [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/) to create a new logo for David's [Eleventy Ghost plugin](https://github.com/daviddarnes/eleventy-plugin-ghost). Take a ghost and add a red balloon!

**Honoring her grandmother.** [Angela "Ge" Ricci](https://gericci.me/) developed [a beautiful site](https://a-cuca.github.io/) to honor her grandmother, Beatriz Pichler Ricci, who recently passed away. It a blog of recipes going back to 2007. It's written in Portuguese, but you can use Google Translate to read it in English.

**Two new starters.** CloudCannon has released a starter called [Campus Spark](https://github.com/CloudCannon/campus-spark-bookshop-template). It's _"a single page website template built in Eleventy for education institutions."_ There's a rather rich [live demo](https://endless-iris.cloudvent.net/) too. And [David Keith](https://dwk.io/) released [11ty-multisite](https://github.com/davidwkeith/11ty-multisite), _"A starter project that demos configuring 11ty for multi-site support."_

Finally, last week, I created was a new category called _11ty Conference_. Upon further consideration, I've changed it to [11ty Conference 2024](/categories/11ty-conference-2024/). We're all looking forward to the 2025 event already, right?

Until next time...
