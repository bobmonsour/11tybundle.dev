### Highlights

> Once again, don't forget to [sign up for news about the upcoming (May 2024) 11ty conference](https://conf.11ty.dev/). See that button at the tippy-top of every page of this site? That takes you there too.

A couple of releases this past week, with 11ty v3.0.0-alpha.5 dropping along with v4.02 of the eleventy-img plugin. Check them out in the links below. Here are some highlights of the latest eleventy-img release:

- Node.js 18+
- Adds fixOrientation
- Adds minimumThreshold
- Fix height on animated GIF sources
- Experimental: new Eleventy Transform plugin for zero-config Image Optimization ([see new docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/#eleventy-transform))

And another reminder about the next Eleventy Meetup. It's on February 20th at 10am CST. The two speakers on tap are [Juha-Matti Santala](https://hamatti.org/) and [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/). [Details here](https://11tymeetup.dev/).

In one of the new posts below, Zach shares his video and slides (all 90 of them) for the recent talk he gave at [TheJam.dev 2024](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2024/) online conference. The post is ["Lessons Learned Moving Eleventy from CommonJS to ESM"](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-v3-esm/).

Progress on this site continues. I've gone live with the new [Categories](/categories/) design. It's also shown on the [by count](/categories-by-count/) page. And while I had envisioned doing this for the [Authors](/authors/) page, it makes much less sense as there are over 300 authors and many of them contain only a single post. So, for not at least, the Authors page will remain as is.

Meanwhile, I'm having fun doing some mental wrestling with an idea around writing a shortcode to reduce some nearly repetitive code. I want to parameterize it. It's my current, and yes...fun...learning challenge.

On a personal note, I am traveling later this week to help our son move into a new apartment...so I might not have the same cadence of posts as in recent weeks. We'll see.

Until next time...
