### Highlights

**Zach's Eleventy Weekly Report №4.** Rather than put it into my own words, I thought I'd just share [Zach's Mastodon post](https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy/112672038105630825) where he's been outlining his weekly progress on all things Eleventy.

**Add a view count and a like button to 11ty.** One of this week's posts shows how to do this with serverless functions. It's written by someone that goes by the handle, Megaemce. [Check it out](https://annoyscript.vercel.app/posts/Adding%20view%20count%20and%20like%20button%20to%2011ty/).

**A post about javascript array performance.** Another of Megaemce's posts is about the performance of various ways of handling large javascript arrays. It's not directly related to Eleventy, but I thought it was worthy of sharing. It's titled ["The fastest way to work with arrays"](https://annoyscript.vercel.app/posts/The%20fastest%20way%20to%20work%20with%20arrays/).

**A minimal v3 starter with ESM.** [Lene Saile](https://www.lene.dev/) has created a new minimal starter for Eleventy v3 that uses ESM. It uses [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/), [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/), and [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/). [Code is here](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-esm-minimal) and [demo is here](https://eleventy-esm-minimal.netlify.app/).

**A facelift here.** In case you didn't notice, I did a facelift on the [home page here](/). It's now filled with some useful info rather than the descriptive about-type text that was there before. I moved that text to the actual [about](/about/) page. Now the home page shows the title of the most recent blog post (that would be this one as of today) along with three lists, each with 11 (yes, 11) of the most recent releases, the most recent posts from the [Firehose](/firehose/), and the most recent sites built with Eleventy. I hope you find it helpful.

Until next time...
