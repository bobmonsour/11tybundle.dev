### Highlights

> Don't miss [TheJam.dev](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2024/) conference. It's a FREE, online conference on January 24th and 25th. [Check it out](https://cfe.dev/events/the-jam-2024/). Zach is one of the speakers along with several of more members of the Eleventy community.

And this just in today. Zach is interviewed by Mike Neumegen, the CEO of CloudCannon. Here, they "Explore the Bounds of Jamstack."

Lastly, I don't know how long this site has been around, but it's new to me. It's a site that showcases Eleventy themes. It's called [Eleventy Themes](https://www.11tythemes.com/). I have not tried any of the themes here, but it sure looks interesting.

Enjoy the 13 posts and 4 sites to see this week.

Until next time...
