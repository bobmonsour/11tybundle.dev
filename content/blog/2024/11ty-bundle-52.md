### A note from Bob:

My ass has been dragging this week, but here we go...better late than never.

### Highlights

**Zach's Eleventy Weekly Report №7.** Here's [Zach's Mastodon post](https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy/112791044369442010) where he's been outlining his weekly progress on all things Eleventy, some of which I recap below.

**Official Template Language Plugins.** Zach has released template language plugins for ejs, handlebars, mustache, and haml. Here are links to the docs for each. Note that these are 3.0 and higher only.

- [ejs docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/ejs/)
- [handlebars docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/handlebars/)
- [mustache docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/mustache/)
- [haml docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/haml/)

Note also that these are not part of the core of Eleventy, but have to be installed individually. See [ejs](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-template-languages/blob/main/ejs/README.md), [handlebars](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-template-languages/blob/main/handlebars/README.md), [mustache](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-template-languages/blob/main/mustache/README.md), and [haml](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-plugin-template-languages/blob/main/haml/README.md) for more information.

**Simpler drafts in alpha.17**. Zach has been working on a simpler way to handle drafts in Eleventy. This will be available in the yet-to-be-released alpha.17. See [this issue comment](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/188#issuecomment-2224060755) for more information.

**Migrations from Jekyll.** Two of this week's post discuss their migration from Jekyll to Eleventy and the "why" behind them. Joining us are [Ethan Marcotte](/authors/ethan-marcotte/) and [Chris Henrick](/authors/chris-henrick/).

**Turning arbitrary files into a collection.** [David Darnes](/authors/david-darnes/) posed the question of how to loop through arbitrary files in Eleventy. As it turns out, it was easier than he thought. See the discussion in [this Mastodon thread](https://mastodon.design/@DavidDarnes/112790792318866394).

**11ty and the Salesforce API.** [Jeff Sikes](/authors/jeff-sikes/) has an interesting post on how he used Eleventy to pull data from the Salesforce API. [Here's his post](https://box464.com/posts/salesforce-eleventy-directory/).

**Generating a responsive CSS background image.** [Phil Rentier Digital](/authors/phil-rentier-digital/) has [a fascinating post](https://medium.com/@rentierdigital/11ty-how-to-use-the-image-plugin-to-generate-responsive-images-for-css-d5236c2111e6) on how he used the image plugin to generate a responsive CSS background image. He worked it all out with the help of our exceptional [Discord community](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/discord/).
