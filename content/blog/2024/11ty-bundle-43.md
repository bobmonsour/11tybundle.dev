### A note from Bob:

I've managed to find an hour here and an hour there, while traveling, so maybe there won't be a gap in my posting. Anyway...we've got a good one this week. Let's get to it!

### Highlights

**The 11ty Conference happened...a roundup.** On May 9th, the 11ty conference aired live, and it was a real good conference about making web sites real good. If you want to watch it from start to finish, the entire conference is [right here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLxJ6PtuF9M&t=1205s).

Here's a set of talk-by-talk links in case you don't want to watch them in order. These links are also in the description of the full video. I'm skipping the [20-minute countdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLxJ6PtuF9M&t=0s), but it was hilarious as at each 11-second mark past the minute, a random voice would say _"eleven"_ in a unique way.

The conference was exceptionally well done and everything was on time. And the talks were varied and interesting.

**New eleventy-img wow-ness.** During Zach's talk on the Future of Eleventy, he showed off a new way to use the [eleventy-img](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) plugin. Just [watch the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLxJ6PtuF9M&t=2156s) and be prepared to be wow'd.

**A POSSE repo.** If you've wondered about POSSE (Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere), in a follow-up to [his talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLxJ6PtuF9M&t=8542s) at the 11ty Conference, [Henry Desroches](https://henry.codes/) has created a [posse-with-11ty](https://github.com/xdesro/posse-with-11ty), _"...a very basic implementation of a POSSE-style microblog publishing strategy using IndieWeb principles and some IndieWeb services."_

**Two new categories.** I've created two new categories here. First, with all of the post-conference reflection posts that I've come across, I've given them a home as the [11ty Conference](/categories/11ty-conference-2024/) category. Second, while there is already a [Drafts category](/categories/drafts/), I noticed that some of them also discussed scheduling. And as I've run across a couple of other posts on scheduling, it felt like it was time to give it its own category. So, [Scheduling](/categories/scheduling/) is now a thing.

**A reading time plugin.** While some of us have written our own implementation of "reading time" to add that to our posts, this plugin by [Max Boll](https://www.makkusu.dev/about/) just surfaced and it's a nice, lightweight, configurable approach for those who don't want to write their own. You can find it on GitHub at [eleventy-plugin-readingtime](https://github.com/MyXoToD/eleventy-plugin-readingtime). He also wrote a [blog post](https://www.makkusu.dev/blog/2024/05/eleventy-reading-time-plugin/) about it.

Until next time...
