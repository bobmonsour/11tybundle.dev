# Project Overview

This project is a website that represents a curated set of resources for using the 11ty static site generator.

The website is itself built using 11ty.

## Coding Standards

### Javascript

In Javascript, use camelCase for variable and function names.

In CSS, prefer Flexbox or Grid layout over older layout techniques.

In CSS, prefer logical properties (e.g., magin-inline-start) over physical properties (e.g., margin-left).
